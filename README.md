Hi, I'm Hiep I'm a writer and computer scientist. I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Vietnam. I spend a lot of time with chickens and alpacas.  mortar_board I'll be teaching Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford in Jan 2021. telescope I'm currently with Snorkel AI, a data-first end-to-end platform for developing AI applications. memo I write a lot! I'm the author of four bestselling Vietnamese books. I'm working on an English book on machine learning interviews. sweat_smile Fun fact: After high school, I went to Brunei for a 3-day vacation which turned into a 3-year trip through Asia, Africa, and South America. During my trip, I worked as a Bollywood extra, a casino hostess, and a street performer. I'm best reached via email. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
